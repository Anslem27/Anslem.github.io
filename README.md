# Anslem27.github.io   `Still limited to desktop`

My personal portfolio website written with flutter.
===

`Work in progress`

__`Note` that this compiled version is stil very unstable and hasnt been configured fully__

[Check out live build here](https://anslem27.github.io/)

Basically showcasing the `canvas web renderer` engine functionality, as well as using this repository to understand basic underlying structure to building a functional flutter web app.

. Based on the canvaskit build as the html renderer builds imperfectly.

__`Note` that this is only the compiled web directory and note the full flutter project__
